This repostery is related to my experience with object-programming with C++, mainly related to my university work. 

Content:

-Database - this is a project that could replace the final exam, if done correctly. I didn't do it during the course, because I had to study hard about other exams and while this project required about 20 hours, the final exam required 2-3hours of preparation and 2 hours to complete it. Therefore I deciided not to skip the exam. However, I accepted the challenge and did this project in the summer.
-DataStructures - during my programming classes using STL structures was stictly forbidden, apart from our last month. Therefore we had to make our own datastructures. I knew that in my 2nd year I would have a course Data Structures and Algorithms so I started reading books about this and decided to implement as many data structures as possible during my summer break.
-Homework In Uni - these are works that I did during my OOP course in uni, most of them are simple tasks, but they were very important because each task focused on different aspects
-Useful stuff - these are some interesting (at least for me) things that I found during my experience with coding or reading and I wanted to share with friends, or just to have in hand if needed. 
-ConsultDemos - Demos used during my consultations
